# Ciao!

👋 Hi, my name is Marco Zanin and I am a Data Analyst.

My interests include: research designs, data analysis, and statistical inference using the likelihood function.

Most of my work has been done using R, but I am currently learning Python 🐍.

Examples of dashboards created in R can be found here https://marcozaninitaly.shinyapps.io/training_load_app/ and 
in Python here https://tennis-atp-app-mz.herokuapp.com/ and on my Github.


I am looking to collaborate on prediction projects.
