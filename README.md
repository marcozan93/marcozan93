# Ciao!

👋 Hi, my name is Marco Zanin, I am a researcher and I have worked as Data Analyst/Scientist and R Shiny Developer.

My interests include: research designs, data analysis, and statistical inference using the likelihood function.

Most of my work has been done using R and Python 🐍.

Examples of dashboards created in R can be found here https://marcozaninitaly.shinyapps.io/training_load_app/ (i.e., rugby union training load monitoring dashboard) and 
in Python here https://tennis-atp-app-mz.herokuapp.com/ (i.e., tennis players' performance dashboard) and on my Github.
(Note: The dashboard published on Heroku is currently unavailable as a paid subscription has been introduced in winter 2022, I am aiming to publish the dashboard on GCP)


I am looking to collaborate on prediction projects in sport analytics.
